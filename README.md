# News Portal Project
This is a C# web application for a news portal where users can manage articles based on their roles. Each user has specific permissions to view, add, modify, or delete news. The app connects to a PostgreSQL database for efficient data management.

The frontend is built with Bootstrap and HTML, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. Iâ€™ve also implemented a search engine for easy article discovery and a commenting system for user interaction.
